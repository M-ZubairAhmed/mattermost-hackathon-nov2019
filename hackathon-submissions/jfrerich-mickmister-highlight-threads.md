## Summary

Add ability to highlight threads in the center channel. When turned on via `Account Settings > Display > Highlight Thread` the user can highlight threads by holding the `<alt>` key and hovering over a post in the center channel. To provide a better UX, the highlight function dims non threaded posts, rather than actually highlighting the currently hovered post.
