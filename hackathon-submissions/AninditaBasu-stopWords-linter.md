This is a submission for a linter app for the Hackathon project.

A demo is available at [https://mattermost-hackathon-stopwords.herokuapp.com/](https://mattermost-hackathon-stopwords.herokuapp.com/).

The aim of this app is to look at the Mattermost documentation and find (and review and remove) words and phrases that might not promote accessibility, diversity, or inclusiveness. 

Since this is only a demo, I used a very short word list. The idea is to have a comprehensive list of do-not-use and use-with-caution words and phrases. The app can also be used as a consistency checker for spellings (for example, `plug-in` vs. `plugin`) and phrasing (for example, `we recommend` vs. `it is recommended`).

I used the GitHub API in the app code.

The code for the app is at [https://github.com/AninditaBasu/mattermost-hackathon-stopWords](https://github.com/AninditaBasu/mattermost-hackathon-stopWords).
