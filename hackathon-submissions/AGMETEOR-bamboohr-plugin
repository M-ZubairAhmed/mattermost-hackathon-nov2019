Link (WIP) - [mattermost-plugin-bamboohr](https://github.com/AGMETEOR/mattermost-plugin-bamboohr)
Description
-----------
Bamboo HR is a software platform for companies to manage their human resourse stuff. For a company that has chosen to use both Mattermost
and Bamboo HR, this plugin would aim to integrate the two. The plugin would provide users (from mattermost) with some important information
about other employees in the company. Without leaving mattermost, a user can view, new people who joined, employees who left, employees
on leave etc.

The idea is to either provide a bot or a button in the chat header where users could click and get this information in the modal. The idea
is fully not formed :)
